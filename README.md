# PROBLEM TWO: CONFERENCE TRACK MANAGEMENT

This project is a solution for a big programming conference planning. It helps to fit the received proposals into the time constraints of the day.

## Features

- The conference has multiple tracks each of which has a morning and afternoon session.
- Each session contains multiple talks.
- Morning sessions begin at 9am and must finish by 12 noon, for lunch.
- Afternoon sessions begin at 1pm and must finish in time for the networking event.
- The networking event can start no earlier than 4:00 and no later than 5:00.
- No talk title has numbers in it.
- All talk lengths are either in minutes (not hours) or lightning (5 minutes).
- Presenters will be very punctual; there needs to be no gap between sessions.

## Implementation

The solution is implemented using Java 17 with Spring Boot. It uses Lombok for reducing boilerplate code and functional programming for a clean and concise code. It also uses `ByteArrayOutputStream` for storing files in memory.

## How to Run

To run the application, you need to have Java 17 installed on your machine. You can run the application using the following command:

```bash
./mvnw spring-boot:run
```

## Note

The solution may give a different ordering or combination of talks into tracks. This is acceptable; you donâ€™t need to exactly duplicate the sample output given here.
